Are you ready to operate, Doctor? - I'd love to, but first I have to perform surgery.

Features
--------

Zoidberg is a small lobster crawler that use Scrapy_ to get surgeon reviews from an Internet message board.
Sometimes it is hard to find real reviews of surgeons in Google.

For example (my case), I have Femoroacetabular Impingement in the hip and the only medical solution is surgery.
I thought Margalet was the best doctor to perform this operation but when I searched with Zoidberg, I realized that
LÃ³pez Carro was a much better choice.

By typing::

    python zoidberg.py -c es -d margalet -a traumatologia -i femoroacetabular -p test.csv -o csv

you get all the Doctor Margalet reviews for the femoroacetabular impingement in the test.csv file.

At this moment it only implements Femoroacetabular Impingement in Spain, but hopefully with some collaboration,
Zoidberg will extend its functionality.
